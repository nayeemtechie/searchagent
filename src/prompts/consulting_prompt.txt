Instructions:
Produce **3 clear blocks** for consulting teams:

Block A: Market Radar (last 2–4 weeks)
- 3–5 bullets max.
- Cover: recent OSS & SaaS releases, evolving features, emerging trends.
- Show “what changed” and “what to tell clients.”

Block B: Competitive Watch (safe internal view)
- Summarize recent Gartner Magic Quadrant Leaders/Challengers and their differentiators.
- Call out use cases top vendors are highlighting and why they win.

Block C: Client-Winning Use Cases + Checklist
- 2–3 short use case stories (problem → action → result) with **KPI anchors** (e.g., CVR, findability, zero-results).
- Add an “Action Checklist” with 3–5 immediate consultant tasks for pilots or diagnostics.

Rules:
- Keep bullets scannable.
- Blend technical & business terms; explain jargon simply if used.
- Include **credible recent sources** (OSS release notes, vendor blogs, Gartner announcements).
- Competitor links are allowed here; external PDFs will only circulate internally.
- Always end with an **Action Checklist**.

Return only the content—no preamble, no metadata.
