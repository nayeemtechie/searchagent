TASK = LINKEDIN_POST (CTO Thought Leadership Style)

Objective:
Generate a LinkedIn-ready post (~200–300 words, not shorter than 180 or longer than 320 words).
It should establish the author as a CTO-mindset leader in ecommerce search and related technology.
It must be concise, scannable, and high-impact.

Structure & Formatting Rules:
1. Hook (≤2 lines):
   - Start with a bold statement, a question, or a sharp observation.
   - Example: “Hybrid search is no longer optional — are ecommerce retailers ready?”

2. Trends (3 concise bullets):
   - Summarize the most recent developments in ecommerce search, retail tech, or AI.
   - Keep each bullet ≤ 2 sentences.

3. Why It Matters:
   - A short paragraph that ties these updates to ecommerce KPIs
     (Findability, Conversion Rate, Zero Results %, AOV, Attributable Sales).

4. Guidance / Checklist:
   - 3–4 action points that readers (consultants, product managers, architects) can consider adopting.
   - Each should be 1 line, formatted with ✅ or ➡️ for scannability.

5. CTO Lens:
   - 1–2 forward-looking sentences that show strategic foresight (12–18 month horizon).
   - Frame it in terms of competitive positioning, customer experience, or tech adoption curve.

6. Call to Action (CTA):
   - Close with an open question that invites discussion.
   - Example: “How is your team preparing for the hybrid search era?”

Style:
- Word Count: 200–300 words.
- Use short paragraphs, line breaks, and bullets for readability.
- Professional but approachable; use emojis sparingly (🚀, 📊, 🧠).
- DO NOT mention competitors by name.
- Assume audience includes both technical (architects, engineers) and non-technical (consultants, business leaders).
