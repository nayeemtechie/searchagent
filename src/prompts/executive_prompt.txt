Instructions:
Produce 1–2 short sections for senior executives.

For each section:
- Start with a concise **business impact headline** (no jargon).
- Include at least one **KPI or data-backed fact** (e.g., CVR, zero-result %, findability, AOV, revenue lift).
- Add one **competitor or peer signal** (e.g., “Amazon is testing…”, “Instacart adopted…”).
- Add one **risk or opportunity** for our company.
- End with **Leadership takeaway:** (one sentence, strategic, non-technical).

Rules:
- 3–5 bullets max per section.
- No algorithm terms (no BM25, no embeddings).
- No raw URLs in the body (links are handled separately).
- Prefer **recent** credible sources (Gartner/blogs/cloud vendors/retail press).
- Avoid competitor links in text (mention names only if needed).

Return only the content—no preamble, no metadata.
